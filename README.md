# ECU Machine Learning Team Project
## Legacy-System-Reverse-Engineering-Challenge

## Team Members
- Premasinghe Jayath
- Ambe Mbong-Nwi Nchang

## Goal
Our team will reverse-engineer a 60-year-old travel reimbursement system using only historical data and employee interviews, applying machine learning techniques to discover hidden business logic patterns and create predictive models that replicate legacy system behavior.

## Scenario
Our team has been hired as ML consultants by ACME Corporation. Their legacy reimbursement system has been running for 60 years, no one knows how it works, but it is still used daily. A new system has been built, but the ACME Corporation is confused by the differences in results. Our mission is to use machine learning to understand the original business logic and create a model that can explain and predict the legacy systemâ€™s behavior.
