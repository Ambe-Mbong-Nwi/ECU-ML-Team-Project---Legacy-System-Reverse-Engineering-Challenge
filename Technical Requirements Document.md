# Technical Requirements
## Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (Week 1-2)

### Deliverables:

1. Data Exploration Report (Jupyter notebook)
   - Statistical summary of all input/output variables
   - Distribution analysis and visualization
   - Correlation analysis between inputs and outputs
   - Outlier detection and analysis
   - Missing data assessment

2. Business Logic Hypothesis (Technical report)
   - Analysis of PRD and interview transcripts
   - Proposed business rules and logic patterns
   - Feature importance hypotheses
   - Potential non-linear relationships identification

3. Feature Engineering Strategy
   - Derived features (e.g., cost per mile, cost per day)
   - Interaction terms and polynomial features
   - Domain-specific transformations
   - Feature scaling and normalization approaches

## Phase 2: Model Development (Week 3-5)

Required ML Approaches (teams must implement at least 4, choose across the categories):

1. Linear Regression Variants
   - Simple linear regression
   - Ridge/Lasso regression with regularization
   - Polynomial regression

2. Tree-Based Methods
   - Decision trees with interpretability analysis
   - Random Forest with feature importance
   - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)

3. Advanced Techniques
   - Support Vector Regression
   - Neural Networks (MLPs)
   - Ensemble methods (stacking, voting)

4. Rule-Based Learning
   - Decision rule extraction
   - Association rule mining
   - Symbolic regression (optional bonus)

### Model Evaluation Framework:

   - Cross-validation strategies (time-series aware if applicable)
   - Multiple evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, accuracy within thresholds)
   - Overfitting detection and prevention
   - Model interpretability analysis
